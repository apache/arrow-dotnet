# Images

This directory contains images used in the Apache Arrow .NET documentation.

## logo.svg

This file is based on the file `arrow-logo_chevrons_black-txt_transparent-bg.svg`
from the [Apache Arrow Visual Identity website](https://arrow.apache.org/visual_identity/)
and has had the height and width modified to fit the documentation header,
while maintaining the original aspect ratio.
The rectangular outline was also removed.

## favicon.png

This file matches the favicon used in the Apache Arrow website and was copied from the
[arrow-site repository](https://github.com/apache/arrow-site/blob/8884e2320ca131081a2617cdf93a222f0e92b6a3/img/logo.png).
